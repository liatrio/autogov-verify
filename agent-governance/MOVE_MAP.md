# Agent-governance extraction move map

This map records the history-preserving relocation from the AutoGov spike at
commit `c11a1b0fbe02de266ba11963abedd0d07f427be9` into the repository-local
companion. The relocation commit changes paths only; package and behavior
changes follow separately.

The deterministic pre-extraction checkpoint was committed as
`c4b06485139f1fc579eda277e605eece461f13c9`. The pure path relocation was then
committed as `db42d1644d4d9bfc8e2917e3b22919c81c5b7faf`, preserving rename history
before any boundary-isolation edits.

Ignored environments and caches under `.venv/`, `.wheels/`, and
`__pycache__/` are deliberately excluded from the move.

The post-move isolation commit
`7e572a88a3439ee8887f17905356dc1ed6dc501d` also duplicates four small
AutoGov-owned helpers so neither dependency graph crosses the artifact/CLI
boundary:

| AutoGov source | Companion-local copy |
| --- | --- |
| `pkg/predicate/predicate.go` (`writeOutput`) | `agent-governance/internal/evidence/output.go` |
| `pkg/predicate/config.go` (embedded-schema validation) | `agent-governance/internal/evidence/schema.go` |
| `pkg/predicate/testresult.go` (wire types/constants) | `agent-governance/internal/evidence/testresult.go` |
| `pkg/predicate/schemas/test-result-schema.json` | `agent-governance/internal/evidence/schemas/test-result-schema.json` |

That same isolation commit copied the signer in the other direction: the
domain-neutral AutoGov-private helper at `pkg/offline/test_signer_test.go`
originated from `agent-governance/internal/demokit/signer.go`. The copy keeps
AutoGov's production and test packages independent of companion Go imports.

The demo's VSA policy metadata migration is deliberate: `predicate.policy.uri`
changed from `https://github.com/liatrio/autogov/examples/agent-governance/policy`
to `https://github.com/liatrio/autogov/agent-governance/policy`. The policy
bytes and the content digest recorded by `checkpoint.sha256.json` are unchanged.

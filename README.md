You cannot trust a build artifact unless you can prove who built it and how. `autogov` produces and verifies [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.2/about) [attestations](https://slsa.dev/attestation-model), evaluates [OPA/Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/policy-language/) policy against them, and emits a pass/fail Verification Summary Attestation (VSA) that records what was checked and whether it passed.

It is a CLI for attestation verification and release management in GitHub-based supply chains.

`v1.0.0` establishes the CLI's commands, flags, and output as its
SemVer-governed public interface. Breaking changes to that interface require a
major version bump.

## The autogov ecosystem

Start here. `autogov` is the CLI at the center of the four-repo autogov stack. The other repositories wrap this CLI for CI use.

| Repo | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **[autogov](https://github.com/liatrio/autogov)** (this repo) | The CLI. Produces and verifies SLSA attestations, evaluates OPA/Rego policy, and emits a pass/fail VSA that gates releases. Start here. |
| **[autogov-workflows](https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows)** | Reusable GitHub Actions workflows that build, attest (SLSA provenance, SBOM, vulnerability scan), and verify artifacts, driven by the autogov CLI. |
| **[autogov-policy-library](https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-policy-library)** | The OPA/Rego policies the CLI evaluates during verification to gate releases. |
| **[autogov-caller-workflows](https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-caller-workflows)** | A runnable example showing how to consume the reusable workflows end to end. |

## Requirements

- Go 1.26 or higher
- GitHub personal access token with read access to packages
- Access to the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
- Docker login to ghcr.io (`docker login ghcr.io`) for container image verification

## Features

- **Multi-attestation verification**: Supports standard in-toto predicate types, including SLSA, SBOM, vulnerability, and custom predicates
- **SLSA v1.2 VSA generation**: Generates Verification Summary Attestations
- **OPA policy integration**: Evaluates Rego policies and records the result in VSA metadata
- **Signer allowlist**: Enforces an approved set of signer certificate identities via `--cert-identity-list` (a URL or local file). Accepts the union of `--cert-identity` and the list (multiple signers per run), and fails closed when a configured list resolves to zero valid identities.
- **Offline verification**: Supports pre-downloaded attestation artifacts (verify container images by digest without pulling the image)
- **Attestation download**: Download attestations from GitHub for offline verification workflows
- **Per-attestation trusted root**: Selects the trusted root for each attestation from its signing certificate's Fulcio issuer — public-good Sigstore (`sigstore.dev`) or GitHub (`fulcio.githubapp.com`) — with `--trusted-root`/`--trusted-root-source` overrides
- **VSA validation**: Validates VSA fields and supports multiple digest formats
- **Release management**: Plan, cut, and publish releases with GitHub API-signed commits (SLSA v1.2 provenance)
- **Changelog generation**: Automatic changelog from conventional commits with markdown or JSON output
- **Configuration mutations**: Update version strings across JSON, YAML, and TOML files during releases
- **Operational basics**: Error handling, caching, and monitoring support

This tool verifies GitHub Artifact Attestations using the sigstore-go v1.2.1 API and supports attestations in the Sigstore bundle format used by [GitHub Artifact Attestations, npm Provenance, Homebrew Provenance, etc](https://blog.sigstore.dev/cosign-verify-bundles/).

## SLSA Posture

autogov is honest about its own [SLSA v1.2](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.2/about) posture on both the build and source tracks: levels are reported from verified evidence, never asserted, and the tool deliberately avoids over-claiming. It is currently a **single-maintainer** project, so it claims **Source L3** (continuously enforced technical controls, which need no human review) and does **not** claim two-party review ("L4") — genuine two-party review is not achievable with one maintainer and remains aspirational until the project gains community co-maintainers.

### Build track — SLSA Build L3

autogov's own releases are built to **[SLSA Build L3](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.2/build-track-basics#build-l3-hardened-builds)**:

- Build and attest jobs run on GitHub-hosted, isolated, ephemeral runners; the build path is guarded so a self-hosted runner fails the job (this applies to the blob build/attest jobs and the ko OCI image alike).
- Build steps cannot reach the signing keys — provenance is generated and signed by GitHub's [`attest-build-provenance`](https://github.com/actions/attest-build-provenance) outside the build step.
- The released binary, the full attestation bundle, and the multi-arch OCI image each carry a signed build-provenance attestation.

The **verifier reports the build level from verified evidence, not from the builder identity**: a VSA records `SLSA_BUILD_LEVEL_3` only when a build-provenance attestation was actually verified **and** the signer identity was enforced (via `--cert-identity` / a signer allowlist); otherwise it records `SLSA_BUILD_LEVEL_0`. The level is computed from what was proven, so it cannot be inflated by trusting an unverified signature.

### Source track — controls enforced + recorded; Source L3 dormant

The repository continuously enforces technical controls on its protected branch and records them in a signed source-review attestation:

- required CI status checks,
- branch protection with force-push blocked,
- linear / retained history (history is not rewritable or deletable),
- no admin or team bypass of these history/force-push controls — the sole allowlisted exception is the release bot.

On the basis of these enforced-and-recorded controls autogov claims **honest Source L3** (the [SLSA v1.2 source track](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.2/source-requirements#source-l3) grants L3 for continuously enforced, recorded technical controls — no human review is required for L3).

This Source L3 claim is **currently dormant.** The v0.1 producer emits an empty `continuityStartRevision`, so the verifier fail-closes the continuity leg and the level stays at the conservative floor — no attestation actually earns L3 yet. It lights up once continuity tracking lands; until then the controls are *enforced and recorded* but the numbered L3 is not yet awarded. The verifier never promotes the level from an unverified signer, and never blocks when the controls are absent.

### Two-party review (the v1.2 "L4" tier) — aspirational, not met

Two-party review is the separate, higher SLSA v1.2 source control (the ["L4" tier](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.2/source-requirements#source-l4)): every change must be agreed to by **two trusted persons** before submission. autogov is **currently maintained by a single maintainer**, so genuine two-party review is not achievable and this tier is **not met** — it's an aspiration the project will adopt as it gains community co-maintainers. Changes receive AI-assisted review as *tooling*, which assists the maintainer but is **not** counted as a second reviewing party.

autogov still *implements* the control as an evidence-driven, non-numbered annotation: because two-party review is **not a numbered level** (there is no `SLSA_SOURCE_LEVEL_4` token), the verifier emits `ORG_SOURCE_TWO_PARTY_REVIEWED` only when a change's source-review attestation shows **two or more distinct approvers** (`summary.distinctApprovers >= 2`). It is never asserted — and because this repo's own releases are self-merged by the sole maintainer (its release verify runs `source_review` at `min_approvals: 0` by disclosed design), autogov's own releases **do not carry** this annotation. The published policy bundle keeps the strict default so adopters with real review teams still gate on it.

See [`verify source`](#verify-source) for how source levels are surfaced from evidence, and [docs/vsa-metadata.md](docs/vsa-metadata.md) for the VSA level fields.

## Verification Process

The tool performs several steps for each attestation:

1. **Trusted Root Selection**: Selects the trusted root per attestation from the signing certificate's Fulcio issuer — a public-good Sigstore (`sigstore.dev`) cert uses the public-good Sigstore root, a GitHub (`fulcio.githubapp.com`) cert uses the GitHub root. The GitHub root is fetched dynamically via `gh attestation trusted-root` with fallback to an embedded copy; the public-good root is embedded.
2. **Parses the OCI reference** to extract organization, repository, and digest
3. **Retrieves attestations** from GitHub's container registry
4. **Verifies the certificate chain** for each attestation using sigstore-go
5. **Validates the attestation signature** with proper timestamp verification
6. **Checks the certificate identity and issuer** against expected values
7. **Verifies the attestation payload** structure and content
8. **(Optional) Validates certificate identity** against an approved source of truth list

Each attestation is verified against:

- **The trusted root for its signing certificate** (GitHub or public-good Sigstore, including both certificate authorities and timestamp authorities)
- **The specified certificate identity** (GitHub Actions workflow)
- **The certificate issuer** (GitHub Actions OIDC provider)
- **(Optional) An approved list** of certificate identities from a source of truth

## Authentication

The tool supports two methods of GitHub authentication:

1. **Auto-detection** (Recommended):
   - Uses `go-gh` to automatically detect credentials from:
     - Environment variables (`GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN`)
     - GitHub CLI configuration
     - System keyring

2. **Manual Configuration**:
   - Set environment variables directly:

     ```bash
     export GH_TOKEN=your_token_here
     # or
     export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
     # or
     export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here
     ```

If testing locally, use a PAT (e.g., a [Classic Personal Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)) with the following permissions:

- `read:packages` permission to access GitHub Container Registry (required for container image verification)
- `repo` permission if verifying private repository artifacts
- Access to the organization/repository you're trying to verify

> **Note**: For container image verification, you must be logged into ghcr.io:
>
>```bash
> echo $GH_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin
> ```
>
> The same token can be used for both GitHub API access and Docker login.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/liatrio/autogov@latest

# Binary will be installed as 'autogov'
```

### Container image

The CLI is also published as a signed multi-arch (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) OCI image to `ghcr.io/liatrio/autogov`:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/liatrio/autogov:latest
docker run --rm ghcr.io/liatrio/autogov:latest version
```

`:latest` tracks the most recent `main` build; for an immutable, reproducible reference pin by digest (`ghcr.io/liatrio/autogov@sha256:<digest>`) — the verification commands below work against a digest reference too.

The image carries a GitHub-issued build-provenance attestation. Verify it with cosign before use:

```bash
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type slsaprovenance \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/liatrio/autogov/' \
  ghcr.io/liatrio/autogov:latest
```

Or with the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/liatrio/autogov:latest --owner liatrio
```

## Usage

### Online Verification

`verify` is a parent command with four subcommands: `attestation` (GitHub artifact attestations), `git` (gitsign commit signatures), `source` (source provenance), and `policy` (repository policy enforcement). Artifact verification uses the `attestation` subcommand:

> Note on transparency anchoring for `git` and `policy`: these commands validate the gitsign CMS signature and signer identity with the cert chain pinned to a trusted timestamp (never the attacker-supplied CMS signing time). GitHub-internal signatures (`fulcio.githubapp.com`) are anchored on the RFC3161 timestamp from `timestamp.githubapp.com`. Public-good signatures (`sigstore.dev`) are anchored on the Rekor transparency-log inclusion entry gitsign embeds in the commit signature, verified offline against the embedded trusted-root log key and pinned to the Rekor integrated time. Both paths are transparency-anchored; a signature whose trusted timestamp cannot be established (no embedded entry, an invalid inclusion proof, or an entry not bound to the commit signature) fails closed (Not Verified).

```bash
autogov verify attestation --repo <owner/repo> [options]
```

#### Required Flags

- `--repo`: Repository to fetch attestations from (format: owner/repo) (required for both image and blob verification)

And one of the following:

- `--image-digest, -d`: Container image digest. Provide either:
  - A bare digest `sha256:<64-hex>` together with `--repo owner/repo` (recommended)
  - Or a full OCI reference `[registry/]owner/repo[:tag]@sha256:<64-hex>` (still requires `--repo owner/repo` for API scoping)
- `--blob-path`: Path to a blob file to verify attestations against (e.g., `--blob-path /path/to/file.txt`)
- Positional digest: you may pass the digest as a positional argument when neither `--image-digest` nor `--blob-path` is provided.

#### Multi-Signer Verification

Pass `--cert-identity` and/or `--cert-identity-list` to enforce a **signer allowlist**. A bundle is accepted if its signer matches the single `--cert-identity` **or** any identity in `--cert-identity-list` — their union, with OR semantics (match at least one). This is useful when an artifact's attestations are produced by more than one workflow (for example an image and its VSA, signed by different reusable workflows), and it lets the allowlist span multiple authorized signer versions so verification survives reusable-workflow version bumps.

```bash
# accept a signature matching --cert-identity OR any identity in --cert-identity-list
autogov verify attestation \
  --repo liatrio/autogov \
  --blob-path artifact.tar.gz \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/.github/workflows/rw-attest-blob.yaml@d709edc9cc501e27f390b7818c9262075ee9e0da" \
  --cert-identity-list "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/refs/heads/main/cert-identities.json"
```

See [Certificate Identity Validation Flags](#certificate-identity-validation-flags) for the list format and allowlist semantics (revoked/expired entries are dropped and verification fails closed on zero valid identities). If you set **neither** flag, any valid Fulcio signature is accepted and an `unsafe` warning is printed.

### verify source

`verify source` verifies a **source provenance** attestation: it confirms the signed bundle matches the expected repository URI and commit SHA, then reports the SLSA source-track level **honestly, from the verified evidence** (see [SLSA Posture](#slsa-posture)). A verified source-provenance signature proves `SLSA_SOURCE_LEVEL_1` (version control plus provenance); the level is never inflated and never inferred from the builder identity.

```bash
autogov verify source \
  --attestation-path source-provenance.json \
  --repo-uri https://github.com/owner/repo \
  --commit abc123 \
  --source-ref refs/heads/main
```

#### Source VSA output

With `--source-vsa-output` the command also emits a standards-shaped SLSA Source VSA (`slsa.dev/verification_summary/v1`) whose subject is the verified source revision. Because that signed VSA asserts `verificationResult: PASSED`, it must not be minted from an unauthenticated signature, so `--source-vsa-output` **requires `--cert-identity`** (the signer is verified rather than accepted via the unsafe fallback):

```bash
autogov verify source \
  --attestation-path source-provenance.json \
  --repo-uri https://github.com/owner/repo \
  --commit abc123 \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/owner/repo/.github/workflows/build.yml@refs/heads/main" \
  --source-vsa-output source-vsa.json \
  --policy-uri "https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-policy-library"
```

#### Promoting the level from enforced controls

Passing `--source-review-attestation-path` (also requiring `--cert-identity`) supplies a signed source-review attestation whose **enforced technical controls** can promote the source level to `SLSA_SOURCE_LEVEL_3` and surface the factual controls as non-numbered `ORG_SOURCE_*` annotations. The promotion is **fail-closed**: when the bundle is absent or unverifiable the level stays at the conservative floor, and the L3 continuity leg is currently dormant (the v0.1 producer emits an empty `continuityStartRevision`), so no attestation earns L3 yet — see [Source track](#source-track--controls-enforced--recorded-source-l3-dormant). Two-party review is a separate control with no numbered token (there is no `SLSA_SOURCE_LEVEL_4`); it surfaces as the `ORG_SOURCE_TWO_PARTY_REVIEWED` annotation when the attestation shows two or more distinct approvers (autogov's own single-maintainer releases do not earn this annotation).

```bash
autogov verify source \
  --attestation-path source-provenance.json \
  --repo-uri https://github.com/owner/repo \
  --commit abc123 \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/owner/repo/.github/workflows/build.yml@refs/heads/main" \
  --source-review-attestation-path source-review.json \
  --allowed-bypass-actor "Integration:801323" \
  --source-vsa-output source-vsa.json \
  --policy-uri "https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-policy-library"
```

#### verify source flags

- `--attestation-path`: Sigstore bundle file containing the source provenance attestation (required)
- `--repo-uri`: expected source repository URI (required)
- `--commit`: expected source commit SHA (required)
- `--source-ref`: expected source ref (e.g., `refs/heads/main`)
- `--cert-identity, -i`: expected OIDC subject in the certificate SAN; required for `--source-vsa-output`, `--generate-vsa`, and `--source-review-attestation-path`
- `--cert-issuer, -s`: expected OIDC issuer URL
- `--source-vsa-output`: output path for the standards-shaped SLSA Source VSA describing the source revision
- `--source-review-attestation-path`: source-review attestation bundle whose enforced technical controls can promote the source level to L3
- `--allowed-bypass-actor`: a ruleset bypass actor allowed as a narrow declared exception when judging L3, as `Type:ID` (e.g. `Integration:801323`); repeatable
- `--policy-uri`: policy URI recorded in the generated VSA
- `--format`: output format: `text`, `json` (default: `text`)
- `-q, --quiet`: only show errors and final status

### verify git

`autogov verify git [revision]` verifies [gitsign](https://github.com/sigstore/gitsign) commit signatures via Sigstore: GitHub-internal signatures are anchored to the RFC3161 timestamp, and public-good signatures are verified against the Rekor inclusion proof. Run `autogov verify git --help` for the full flag set.

### verify policy

`autogov verify policy` verifies gittuf-style repository policy enforcement (branch protection and related controls). Run `autogov verify policy --help` for the full flag set.

### Offline Verification

The tool supports offline verification for air-gapped environments or archived attestations:

#### Download Attestations

First, download attestations while online (requires GitHub token):

```bash
# Download attestations for a blob artifact
autogov download \
  --blob-path artifact.tar.gz \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --output attestations.jsonl

# Download attestations for a container image by digest
autogov download \
  --image-digest sha256:abc123... \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --output attestations.jsonl

# Download attestations using digest directly as argument (works for both blobs and images)
autogov download \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --output attestations.jsonl \
  sha256:abc123...
```

**Download Command Flags:**

- `--blob-path`: Path to a local blob file to download attestations for
- `--image-digest`: Container image digest (e.g., `sha256:...`)
- `--repo, -R`: Repository to download attestations from (format: `owner/repo`) (required)
- `--output, -o`: Output file path for attestation bundles (required)
- `--format`: Output format: `json` or `jsonl` (default: `jsonl`)
- `-q, --quiet`: Only show errors and final results

#### Verify Offline

Then verify offline using the downloaded attestations:

```bash
# Verify with blob file
autogov offline \
  --attestations attestations.jsonl \
  --blob-path artifact.tar.gz \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/owner/repo/.github/workflows/build.yml@sha" \
  --cert-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"

# Verify container image by digest
autogov offline \
  --attestations attestations.jsonl \
  --image-digest "sha256:46a0df552ddbd5bfb4cc738a0f316e4060cc5b06e5fc0a8dac3a8c7e33b6992f" \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/owner/repo/.github/workflows/build.yml@sha" \
  --cert-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"

# Attestation-only verification (no artifact)
autogov offline \
  --attestations attestations.jsonl \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/owner/repo/.github/workflows/build.yml@sha" \
  --cert-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"

# Multi-signer allowlist (union of --cert-identity and --cert-identity-list)
autogov offline \
  --attestations attestations.jsonl \
  --blob-path artifact.tar.gz \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/.github/workflows/rw-attest-blob.yaml@d709edc9cc501e27f390b7818c9262075ee9e0da" \
  --cert-identity-list "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/refs/heads/main/cert-identities.json" \
  --cert-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
```

#### Offline Verification Flags

- `--attestations`: Path to pre-downloaded attestation bundles file (required)
- `--blob-path`: Path to artifact file or directory containing multiple artifacts to verify (optional, calculates SHA256 digest for single files)
- `--image-digest`: SHA256 digest for container image verification (optional, use when image cannot be pulled offline)
- `--cert-identity`: Certificate identity (workflow URL with commit SHA). Supplying `--cert-identity` and/or `--cert-identity-list` enforces a signer allowlist; if neither is provided, any valid Fulcio signature is accepted (unsafe)
- `--cert-identity-list`: Signer allowlist — URL or local file path to a certificate identity list; enforced as a signer allowlist, usable with or without `--cert-identity` (their union is accepted)
- `--no-cache`: Disable caching of the certificate identity list
- `--policy-bundle-digest`: Expected SHA-256 (`sha256:...`) of the downloaded policy bundle asset; enforced for `ghrel://` bundle paths (distinct from `--image-digest`)
- `--cert-issuer`: Certificate issuer (defaults to GitHub Actions)
- `--source-ref`: Source repository ref to verify against (e.g., `refs/heads/main`)
- `--trusted-root`: Path to custom trusted root JSON file (takes precedence over `--trusted-root-source`)
- `--trusted-root-source`: Trusted root source selection: `github`, `public`, or `auto` (default: `auto`)
- `--generate-vsa`: Generate Verification Summary Attestation after successful verification
- `--vsa-output`: Output path for generated VSA (required if `--generate-vsa` is used)
- `--policy-uri`: Policy URI for VSA generation (required if `--generate-vsa` is used)
- `--policy-bundle-path`: Policy bundle source — local directory, `.tar.gz`, `http(s)://` URL, `oci://registry/repo:tag`, or `ghrel://owner/repo[@tag][?asset=bundle.tar.gz]` (without `@tag`, `ghrel://` uses the latest release)
- `--policy-data-path`: Path to JSON file containing additional OPA data (e.g., vulnerability thresholds)
- `--policy-schemas-path`: JSON schemas source for OPA validation — local directory, `.tar.gz`, `http(s)://` URL, `oci://`, or `ghrel://owner/repo[@tag][?asset=schemas.tar.gz]` (default asset `schemas.tar.gz`)
- `--fail-on-policy-error`: Exit with error when policy evaluation fails (default: false)
- `-q, --quiet`: Only show errors and final results

**Trusted Root Source Options:**

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `github` | Use GitHub's private Sigstore deployment (fulcio.githubapp.com) |
| `public` | Use public Sigstore infrastructure (fulcio.sigstore.dev) |
| `auto` | Auto-detect based on certificate issuer (default) |

The `auto` mode examines each attestation's signing certificate to determine the appropriate trusted root. The discriminator is the **Fulcio CA that issued the certificate**, not the OIDC issuer — the OIDC issuer (`https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`) is identical for both GitHub Actions on public repos (signed against public-good Sigstore) and on private repos (signed against GitHub's Fulcio), so it cannot distinguish them:
- Certificate issued by public-good Sigstore Fulcio (`sigstore.dev`) → Public Sigstore trusted root (the case for public repositories, whose attestations carry a Rekor integrated timestamp)
- Certificate issued by GitHub Fulcio (`fulcio.githubapp.com`) → GitHub trusted root (the case for private repositories)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Uses sigstore-go for all verification
- Handles large attestations (up to 10MB per line in JSONL files)
- Transparency log verification is automatically skipped in offline mode
- Supports both JSON and JSONL attestation formats

### Optional Flags

- `--cert-identity, -i`: Certificate identity to verify against (GitHub Actions workflow URL). If not provided, any valid signature will be accepted.
  - For blob verification, the organization and repository are extracted from this URL
  - Format: `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/.github/workflows/...`
- `--cert-issuer, -s`: Certificate issuer to verify against (default: <https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com>)
- `--source-ref, -r`: Source repository ref to verify against (e.g., refs/heads/main)
- `--quiet, -q`: Only show errors and final results

#### Certificate Identity Validation Flags

The tool supports enforcing a signer allowlist via a certificate identity list:

- `--cert-identity-list`: Signer allowlist — a URL or local file path to a certificate identity list. Accepted identities are enforced as the set of allowed signers, usable with or without `--cert-identity` (their union is accepted). Revoked/expired entries are dropped, and verification fails closed if an enforced list resolves to zero valid identities. Example: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/refs/heads/main/cert-identities.json`
- `--no-cache`: Disable caching of the certificate identity list

#### VSA and Policy Flags

The tool supports generating SLSA v1.2 Verification Summary Attestations (VSAs) with enhanced validation and evaluating OPA policies:

- `--generate-vsa`: Generate a VSA after successful verification with field validation
- `--vsa-output`: Path to save the generated VSA (e.g., `./verification-summary.json`)
- `--policy-bundle-path`: Policy bundle source — local directory, `.tar.gz`, `http(s)://` URL, `oci://registry/repo:tag`, or `ghrel://owner/repo[@tag][?asset=bundle.tar.gz]`
- `--policy-schemas-path`: JSON schemas source — local directory, `.tar.gz`, `http(s)://` URL, `oci://`, or `ghrel://owner/repo[@tag][?asset=schemas.tar.gz]`
- `--policy-data-path`: Path to JSON file containing additional OPA data (e.g., vulnerability thresholds)
- `--policy-uri`: Policy URI for VSA generation (required if --generate-vsa is used)
- `--fail-on-policy-error`: Exit with error code 1 when policy evaluation fails (default: false - exit code 0)
- `--attestations-path`: Path to directory containing attestation files for offline verification

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used for authentication:

- `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN`: GitHub personal access token with read access to packages

All command line flags can be set via environment variables:

- `CERT_IDENTITY`: Alternative to --cert-identity flag
- `CERT_ISSUER`: Alternative to --cert-issuer flag
- `SOURCE_REF`: Alternative to --source-ref flag
- `QUIET`: Alternative to --quiet flag
- `CERT_IDENTITY_LIST`: Alternative to --cert-identity-list flag

- `FAIL_ON_POLICY_ERROR`: Alternative to --fail-on-policy-error flag (set to "true" to exit with error on policy failures)
- `POLICY_DATA_PATH`: Alternative to --policy-data-path flag
- `TRUSTED_ROOT_SOURCE`: Alternative to --trusted-root-source flag (values: `github`, `public`, `auto`)

### Changelog Generation

Generate a changelog from conventional commits:

```bash
autogov changelog [flags]
```

#### Changelog Flags

- `--from`: Starting ref (tag/branch/SHA); empty discovers latest tag
- `--to`: Ending ref (default: `HEAD`)
- `-o, --output`: Output file path (default: stdout)
- `--format`: Output format: `markdown`, `json` (default: `markdown`)
- `--repo-path`: Path to git repository (default: `.`)
- `--include-all`: Include non-releasable commit types (docs, chore, test, etc.)
- `--first-parent`: Follow only first parent (merge commits) for history
- `--version`: Version header; if empty and `--to` is a semver tag, derived from tag

#### Changelog Examples

```bash
# Generate changelog since last tag
autogov changelog

# Generate changelog between two tags
autogov changelog --from v0.3.0 --to v0.4.0

# Output as JSON
autogov changelog --format json

# Save to file
autogov changelog -o CHANGELOG.md

# Include all commit types (docs, chore, test, etc.)
autogov changelog --include-all
```

### Release Management

The `release` command provides a full release workflow with three subcommands.

#### `release plan` — Preview a release

```bash
autogov release plan [flags]
```

Analyzes commits since the last tag, determines the next semantic version, and shows what would be included in a release.

**Flags:**

- `--from`: Base ref to compare from (default: latest tag)
- `--to`: Target ref to compare to (default: `HEAD`)
- `--first-parent`: Only follow first parent commits in merge history
- `-o, --output`: Output format: `text`, `json`, `yaml` (default: `text`)
- `--repo`: Path to git repository (default: `.`)
- `--mutations-config`: Path to mutations config file for file update preview
- `--mode`: Git read mode — `auto` (default), `api` (discover tags/commits via the GitHub API; works without a full clone, needs a token), `local` (go-git only)

#### `release cut` — Execute a release

```bash
autogov release cut [flags]
```

Applies file mutations, creates a release commit and tag via GitHub API (providing SLSA v1.2 provenance through GitHub's auto-signing), and creates a draft GitHub release.

**Flags:**

- `--plan-file`: Path to pre-generated release plan (JSON/YAML)
- `--branch`: Expected branch to cut release from (default: `main`)
- `--remote`: Git remote to push to (default: `origin`)
- `--mutations-config`: Path to mutations config file
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be done without making changes
- `--publish`: Publish the release directly (skip the draft state)
- `--mode`: Git read mode: `auto` (default), `api` (require GitHub API), `local` (go-git only)
- `--asset`: File to upload as a release asset (repeatable)
- `--asset-source`: Directory to recursively collect release assets from as `ID=DIR` (repeatable)
- `--asset-label`: Display label for an asset as `name=label`, where `name` is the final upload name (repeatable)
- `--repo`: Path to git repository (default: `.`)
- `--commit-author`: Author name for release commit (default: `autogov[bot]`)
- `--commit-email`: Author email for release commit (default: `autogov[bot]@users.noreply.github.com`)
- `-o, --output`: Output format: `text`, `json` (default: `text`)

Explicit `--asset` files keep their basenames as upload names and remain repeatable for compatibility. Each `--asset-source ID=DIR` is searched recursively; zero-byte files are ignored, and the command fails if a source contains no non-empty regular files. Source-discovered files named `vsa-*.json` are always namespaced as `vsa-<sanitized-ID>-<suffix>.json`. The sanitized ID is lowercase, replaces each run of non-letter/digit characters with one hyphen, and trims leading or trailing hyphens. This also applies when the original basename already includes the source ID: for example, `--asset-source image=dist/image` maps `dist/image/vsa-image-PASSED.json` to `vsa-image-image-PASSED.json`. Other source-discovered files keep their basenames. Final upload names must be unique across explicit assets and all sources.

Use those final upload names with `--asset-label`. For example, label the derived VSA above with `--asset-label vsa-image-image-PASSED.json="Image VSA"`. Release resume matching also uses final upload names.

Draft releases created with explicit `--asset` arguments before adopting `--asset-source` may contain the old explicit VSA basenames. Finish those drafts with the original arguments, or clean the old assets from the draft before switching to source-derived names; the command does not automatically alias or delete old draft assets.

#### `release publish` — Publish a draft release

```bash
autogov release publish [flags]
```

Publishes a draft GitHub release, making it visible to users.

**Flags:**

- `--tag`: Specific tag to publish (mutually exclusive with `--latest`; requires a user token, as GitHub App tokens cannot discover drafts)
- `--latest`: Publish latest draft release (mutually exclusive with `--tag`; requires a user token, as GitHub App tokens cannot discover drafts)
- `--release-id`: Publish by release ID (works with GitHub App tokens)
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be done without publishing
- `--repo`: Path to git repository (default: `.`)
- `-o, --output`: Output format: `text`, `json` (default: `text`)

#### Release Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Preview the release
autogov release plan

# 2. Cut the release (creates commit, tag, and draft release)
autogov release cut --mutations-config .autogov-mutations.yaml

# 3. After CI passes, publish
autogov release publish --latest
```

### Version

Print build version information:

```bash
autogov version
```

## Examples

Verify a container image:

```bash
export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
autogov verify attestation \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/.github/workflows/rw-attest-image.yaml@d709edc9cc501e27f390b7818c9262075ee9e0da" \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --image-digest "sha256:ee911cb4dba66546ded541337f0b3079c55b628c5d83057867b0ef458abdb682" \
  --source-ref refs/heads/main
```

Verify a blob file:

```bash
export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
autogov verify attestation \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/.github/workflows/rw-attest-blob.yaml@d709edc9cc501e27f390b7818c9262075ee9e0da" \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --blob-path path/to/your/file \
  --source-ref refs/heads/main
```

Using environment variables:

```bash
export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
export CERT_IDENTITY="https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/.github/workflows/rw-attest-image.yaml@d709edc9cc501e27f390b7818c9262075ee9e0da"
export CERT_ISSUER=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
autogov verify attestation --repo owner/repo -d "sha256:702bea33d240c2f0a1d87fe649a49b52f533bde2005b3c1bc0be7859dd5e4226"
```

Verify with certificate identity validation:

```bash
export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
autogov verify attestation \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/.github/workflows/rw-attest-image.yaml@d709edc9cc501e27f390b7818c9262075ee9e0da" \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --image-digest "sha256:ee911cb4dba66546ded541337f0b3079c55b628c5d83057867b0ef458abdb682" \
  --cert-identity-list "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/refs/heads/main/cert-identities.json"
```

Generate enhanced VSA with policy evaluation (policy bundle pulled from an OCI registry):

```bash
export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
autogov verify attestation \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/.github/workflows/rw-attest-image.yaml@d709edc9cc501e27f390b7818c9262075ee9e0da" \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --image-digest "sha256:ee911cb4dba66546ded541337f0b3079c55b628c5d83057867b0ef458abdb682" \
  --generate-vsa \
  --vsa-output ./verification-summary.json \
  --policy-uri "https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-policy-library" \
  --policy-bundle-path "oci://ghcr.io/liatrio/autogov-policy-library:latest"
```

The policy bundle can also be pulled from a GitHub release asset with the `ghrel://` scheme (omit `@tag` for the latest release):

```bash
export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
autogov verify attestation \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/.github/workflows/rw-attest-image.yaml@d709edc9cc501e27f390b7818c9262075ee9e0da" \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --image-digest "sha256:ee911cb4dba66546ded541337f0b3079c55b628c5d83057867b0ef458abdb682" \
  --generate-vsa \
  --vsa-output ./verification-summary.json \
  --policy-uri "https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-policy-library" \
  --policy-bundle-path "ghrel://liatrio/autogov-policy-library?asset=bundle.tar.gz" \
  --policy-schemas-path "ghrel://liatrio/autogov-policy-library?asset=schemas.tar.gz"
```

Verify a cosign-signed artifact using public Sigstore:

```bash
# Verify an artifact signed with cosign sign --yes (public Sigstore)
autogov offline \
  --attestations attestations.jsonl \
  --blob-path artifact.tar.gz \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/owner/repo/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/main" \
  --cert-issuer "https://accounts.google.com" \
  --trusted-root-source public

# Or use auto-detection (recommended)
autogov offline \
  --attestations attestations.jsonl \
  --blob-path artifact.tar.gz \
  --trusted-root-source auto
```

Generate VSA with custom vulnerability thresholds:

```bash
# Create threshold configuration file
cat > thresholds.json << 'EOF'
{
  "vulnerability_thresholds": {
    "critical": 0,
    "high": 5,
    "medium": 20,
    "low": -1
  }
}
EOF

export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
autogov verify attestation \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/.github/workflows/rw-attest-image.yaml@d709edc9cc501e27f390b7818c9262075ee9e0da" \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --image-digest "sha256:ee911cb4dba66546ded541337f0b3079c55b628c5d83057867b0ef458abdb682" \
  --generate-vsa \
  --vsa-output ./verification-summary.json \
  --policy-uri "https://github.com/liatrio/autogov-policy-library" \
  --policy-bundle-path bundle.tar.gz \
  --policy-data-path thresholds.json \
  --fail-on-policy-error
```

**Threshold Values:**
- `0`: No vulnerabilities allowed (zero tolerance)
- Positive number: Maximum allowed count
- `-1`: Unlimited (disable check for that severity)

## Output

The tool provides detailed output about the verification process, including human-readable predicate type names:

```shell
Starting verification process...
---
Certificate identity validation enabled
Using identity source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liatrio/autogov-workflows/main/cert-identities.json
---
✓ Certificate identity validated against source of truth
Verifying attestation 1 (Vulnerability Scan: https://in-toto.io/attestation/vulns/v0.2)...

✓ Attestation 3 verified successfully
---
Verifying attestation 4 (AutoGov Metadata: https://autogov.dev/attestation/metadata/v1)...
✓ Attestation 4 verified successfully
---

Summary:
✓ Successfully verified 4 attestations

Attestation Types:
1. Vulnerability Scan (https://in-toto.io/attestation/vulns/v0.2)
2. CycloneDX SBOM (https://cyclonedx.org/bom)
3. SLSA Provenance (https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1)
4. AutoGov Metadata (https://autogov.dev/attestation/metadata/v1)
```

Note: Predicate types not in the registry are displayed as "Unknown" with a warning, but verification continues normally.

## Trusted Root Management

The tool verifies each attestation against the trusted root that matches its signing certificate. Two roots are supported, both carrying the certificate authorities and timestamp authorities required for Sigstore verification:

- **Public-good Sigstore** — used by public repositories (their GitHub Actions attestations are signed against public-good Fulcio and carry a Rekor integrated timestamp). The root is embedded in the binary.
- **GitHub** — used by private repositories (signed against GitHub's `fulcio.githubapp.com` Fulcio). The root is fetched dynamically via `gh attestation trusted-root`, with fallback to an embedded copy.

### Per-Attestation Selection

In the default `auto` mode the root is chosen per attestation from the **Fulcio CA that issued the signing certificate**, not from the OIDC issuer. The OIDC issuer (`https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`) is the same for both public and private GitHub Actions flows, so it cannot be the discriminator; the issuing Fulcio CA can:

- Certificate issued by public-good Sigstore Fulcio (`sigstore.dev`) → public-good Sigstore root
- Certificate issued by GitHub Fulcio (`fulcio.githubapp.com`) → GitHub root

Use `--trusted-root-source github|public|auto` to force a root, or `--trusted-root <file>` to supply a custom one (takes precedence over `--trusted-root-source`).

### Dynamic Fetching (GitHub root)

When the GitHub root is needed, the tool tries `gh attestation trusted-root` first (requires network access to GitHub's API and a valid token) and falls back to the embedded copy if the fetch fails:

```text
✓ Using dynamically fetched trusted root
```

or

```text
! Failed to fetch dynamic trusted root (...), falling back to embedded version
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure your GitHub token has the necessary permissions (see Authentication section above)
   - Check that the token is properly set in environment variables
   - Verify you have access to the GitHub organization
   - For container image verification, ensure you're logged into ghcr.io

2. **Certificate Verification Failures**
   - Verify the certificate identity matches your GitHub Actions workflow
   - Ensure the workflow URL is correct, including the branch/tag
   - Check that the certificate issuer matches GitHub's OIDC provider

3. **No Attestations Found**
   - Confirm the image digest is correct
   - Verify the image exists in the GitHub Container Registry
   - Check that attestations were generated during the build process
   - Ensure you have permission to access the container image

4. **Invalid Digest Format**
   - Ensure the digest follows the format: `sha256:hash`
   - When using full OCI references, include the registry: `ghcr.io/owner/repo@sha256:hash`

5. **`failed to verify timestamps: threshold not met ... 0 < 1`, or a persistently FAILED VSA**
   - A timestamp-threshold error (e.g. `threshold not met for verified signed & log entry integrated timestamps: 0 < 1`) on public-repo attestations, or a long-standing FAILED VSA caused by policy bundles/schemas not loading, is fixed by upgrading to **autogov v0.29.8 or later**, which adds public-good Sigstore verification, `ghrel://` policy-bundle/schema fetching, and schemas-extraction fixes.

If you encounter any other issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/liatrio/autogov/issues/new) and include as much detail as possible.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26 or higher
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for trusted root fetching
- Docker for container registry access
- golangci-lint for code quality checks
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev) for build automation
- GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/liatrio/autogov
cd autogov

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run tests
task test

# Build binary
task build

# Run linter
task lint
```

### Available Task Commands

The project uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev) for build automation.

```bash
task --list       # Show all available tasks
task              # Run verify and build (default)
task build        # Build the binary
task test         # Run tests with coverage
task lint         # Run linter
task format       # Format code
task verify       # Run format, lint, and test
task install      # Install binary to /usr/local/bin
task clean        # Clean build artifacts
```

### Reproducible Builds

`task build` produces a deterministic binary. The embedded `main.date` is derived from the commit timestamp (`git show -s --format=%cI HEAD`) rather than wall-clock time, so the build does not vary by when it runs. The binary is built with `-trimpath` and `CGO_ENABLED=0` to strip local filesystem paths and avoid C toolchain variance. As a result, rebuilding the same commit yields byte-identical output.

### Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
go test ./...

# Integration tests with real attestations
export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
go test -tags=integration ./...

# Test with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Benchmark tests
go test -bench=. ./...
```

### Debugging

```bash
# build with debug symbols
go build -o bin/autogov-debug .

# run with delve
dlv debug . -- verify attestation --repo "owner/repo" -d "sha256:..."

# run tests with race detector
go test -race ./...

# cpu/memory profiling
go test -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -bench=. ./...
go tool pprof cpu.prof

go test -memprofile=mem.prof -bench=. ./...
go tool pprof mem.prof
```
